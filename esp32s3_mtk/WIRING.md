# Version 2 wiring — ESP32-S3 Super Mini

AHT, HC-SR04+ and Grove TSL2561 have worked in the user's hardware tests. The ST7789 LCD is not working for now; retain its existing connections while running the current ESP-IDF / µT-Kernel SMP sensor target.

## Complete breadboard connections

These tables retain the Version 2 layout. They apply to the ESP32-S3 Super Mini, AHT temperature/humidity module, **3.3 V-compatible HC-SR04+**, Grove TSL2561 and the existing ST7789 display wiring. Disconnect USB before changing connections. Follow the printed pin labels on each module.

### Breadboard layout and jumper leads

- On the terminal strip, **A–E share the same numbered row**. F–J share a separate row on the other side of the centre gap. Adjacent numbered rows are separate.
- The ESP32 and modules remain outside the breadboard. Each connection can use **device male header → female-to-female lead → male-to-male lead → breadboard hole**. Seat the male-to-male pin fully inside the female connector.
- The light sensor uses its Grove cable; route its four signal leads to the holes listed below, using adapters as required by the cable ends. Identify leads by signal, rather than assuming a colour or connector orientation.
- **N1, N2 and N3 are chosen hole names, not printed breadboard coordinates.** Use your selected top hole and the next two consecutive holes in the **same continuous blue/minus power-rail section**. A split in a rail breaks continuity.
- All grounds are common. Power comes from the ESP32 **3V3** pin; the 5V pin is not used in this layout.

### ESP32-S3 → breadboard

| ESP32 printed pin | Breadboard hole | Purpose | Current firmware |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3V3 | A4 | Shared 3.3 V supply | Used |
| GPIO1 | A5 | Shared I²C SDA for AHT and TSL2561 | Used |
| GPIO2 | A6 | Shared I²C SCL for AHT and TSL2561 | Used |
| GND | A7 | Shared ground | Used |
| GPIO4 | A8 | Ultrasonic TRIG output | Used |
| GPIO5 | A9 | Ultrasonic ECHO input | Used |
| GPIO6 | A10 | LCD SPI clock | Retain; LCD disabled |
| GPIO7 | A11 | LCD SPI MOSI | Retain; LCD disabled |
| GPIO9 | A12 | LCD reset | Retain; LCD disabled |
| GPIO8 | A13 | LCD data/command | Retain; LCD disabled |
| GPIO10 | A14 | LCD chip select | Retain; LCD disabled |

### AHT temperature/humidity → breadboard

| AHT printed pin | Breadboard hole | Connected through that row to |
|---|---|---|
| VCC / VIN | E4 | ESP32 3V3 at A4 |
| SDA | E5 | ESP32 GPIO1 at A5 |
| SCL | E6 | ESP32 GPIO2 at A6 |
| GND | E7 | ESP32 GND at A7 |

The AHT uses I²C address **0x38**. Position wires by the module's printed labels; pin order can differ between AHT boards.

### HC-SR04+ ultrasonic → breadboard

| Ultrasonic printed pin | Breadboard hole | Connected through that row to |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | C4 | ESP32 3V3 at A4 |
| TRIG | E8 | ESP32 GPIO4 at A8 |
| ECHO | E9 | ESP32 GPIO5 at A9 |
| GND | C7 | ESP32 GND at A7 |

This layout uses the identified **HC-SR04+ with 3.3 V operation and a 3.3 V-compatible ECHO output**, so the ECHO voltage divider is omitted. It is not the wiring specification for a standard 5 V HC-SR04.

### Grove TSL2561 digital light sensor → breadboard

| Grove cable signal | Breadboard hole | Connected through that row to |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | D4 | ESP32 3V3 at A4 |
| SDA | D5 | ESP32 GPIO1 at A5; shared with AHT |
| SCL | D6 | ESP32 GPIO2 at A6; shared with AHT |
| GND | D7 | ESP32 GND at A7 |

The TSL2561 shares the I²C bus with the AHT. The profile validates the part ID at its configured address. The preset uses **0x29**; set `i2c.addr` to **0x39** or **0x49** if that is your module's address. These addresses do not conflict with the AHT's 0x38.

### ST7789 TFT LCD → breadboard (retain existing wiring)

**LCD is not working for now:** it has shown a dim/white screen without text. Its existing connections can remain while the other sensors are used. The current µT-Kernel firmware does not initialise or update the LCD and leaves GPIO6–10 unused. Keeping it connected does not enable display output.

| LCD printed pin | Breadboard hole | Electrical connection | Current firmware |
|---|---|---|---|
| GND | Blue rail N2 | Ground via N1 and B7 | Retain |
| VCC | B4 | ESP32 3V3 via A4 | Retain |
| SCL | E10 | ESP32 GPIO6 via A10; SPI SCK | Retain; unused |
| SDA | E11 | ESP32 GPIO7 via A11; SPI MOSI | Retain; unused |
| RST | E12 | ESP32 GPIO9 via A12 | Retain; unused |
| DC | E13 | ESP32 GPIO8 via A13 | Retain; unused |
| CS | E14 | ESP32 GPIO10 via A14 | Retain; unused |
| BL | Blue rail N3 | Ground; retained active-low BL arrangement | Retain; module-specific |

The LCD's **SCL/SDA labels mean SPI clock/MOSI**, not the I²C SCL/SDA used by the AHT and TSL2561. Do not join those display signals to rows 5/6. No MISO connection is used.

The BL-to-ground entry preserves the active-low backlight arrangement previously selected for this display module. BL wiring differs between ST7789 breakout boards; this is not a universal ST7789 pinout.

### Ground-rail jumper

| From | To | Lead | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| B7 | Blue rail N1 | One male-to-male wire | Connect the blue rail to ESP32 GND through row 7 |
| LCD GND | Blue rail N2 | LCD connection above | Share the same grounded rail section |
| LCD BL | Blue rail N3 | LCD connection above | Retain the existing module's BL connection |

**B7 is ground. B5 is SDA and must not be connected to the ground rail.** N2/N3 are connected through the continuous rail; no extra N1→N2 or N2→N3 jumper is needed within that section.

### Resistors

| Connection | Extra resistor in this setup |
|---|---|
| HC-SR04+ ECHO → GPIO5 | None for the identified 3.3 V-compatible module |
| AHT/TSL2561 I²C SDA and SCL | No additional pull-ups with the existing breakout modules' pull-ups; pull-ups must go to 3V3 |
| LCD signal/BL connections | No new resistor added; preserve the existing breakout arrangement |

Bare sensors or different breakout revisions may need different power, pull-up or backlight circuitry. These tables describe the current modules and retained wiring.
